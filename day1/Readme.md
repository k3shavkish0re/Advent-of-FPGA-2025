# HDL Puzzle Simulation Project

## Directory Structure

- **design.sv** – Puzzle 1  
- **design2.sv** – Puzzle 2  
- **Generated_tb_puzzle1.sv** – Testbench for Puzzle 1  
- **Generated_tb_puzzle2.sv** – Testbench for Puzzle 2  
- **Input_to_tb.py** – Python script to convert given input into a meaningful testbench (partially generated by AI)

## Simulation Environment

All HDL simulations were executed using **Cadence Xcelium**.

### Simulation Command

xrun -sv <testbench file name> <DUT file name>

## Use of AI

- **AI was not used** for the Design Under Test (DUT).  
- The provided inputs were not directly compatible with HDL simulation and required significant processing.  
- **AI assistance** was utilized to transform and structure the inputs efficiently into a usable testbench format.  
- This approach saved development time, especially since the problems were more suited to high-level language manipulation than direct HDL implementation.
