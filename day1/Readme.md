# HDL Puzzle Project

## Overview
This project involves designing and testing hardware description language (HDL) modules for two puzzle challenges. The DUTs (Design Under Test) are implemented in SystemVerilog, and testbenches are generated with the help of AI to handle input processing efficiently.

## Directory Structure
- `design.sv` – Puzzle 1  
- `design2.sv` – Puzzle 2  
- `Generated_tb_puzzle1.sv` – Testbench for Puzzle 1  
- `Generated_tb_puzzle2.sv` – Testbench for Puzzle 2  
- `Input_to_tb.py` – Python script to convert the given input into a meaningful testbench (partially generated by AI)

## Simulation Environment
HDL simulations were performed using **Cadence Xcelium**.

### Simulation Command
```bash
xrun -sv <testbench file name> <DUT file name>


xrun -sv Generated_tb_puzzle2.sv design2.sv
